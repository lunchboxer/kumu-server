# Kumu-webclient

This is [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) app to provide classroom tool for Chinese ESL teachers. It's based on [svelte v3 webpack template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template-webpack#v3).

## Get started

*with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed...*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd kumu-webclient
npm install
```

This app also uses fontawesome icons font so you'll need to copy the solid font files into the directory `public/font-awesome`

It also serves the nunito font locally, so that should be copied from node_modules/nunito-fontface into `public/nunito`

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
